                My name is Jamie Thompson <br /><br />
                I am a 21 year old developer interested in furthering my knowledge 
                and experience preferably in a front end position. I have had an interest 
                in programming for as long as i can remember and over the past 3 years 
                have significantly improved my knowledge and skillset within web dev.
