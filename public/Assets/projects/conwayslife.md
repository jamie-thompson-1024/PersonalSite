A JavaScipt/Typescript module I created that runs Conways Game of Life 
a form of cellular automata. This module has a build for both browsers and nodeJS. 
Within the repo there is also a demo webpage, a link to which is provided above. 
The README.md file in the repo well documents the modules usage and features.
